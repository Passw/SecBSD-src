Subject: Welcome to SecBSD 1.5!

This message attempts to describe the most basic initial questions that a
system administrator of an SecBSD box might have.  You are urged to save
this message for later reference.

For more information on how to set up your SecBSD system, refer to the
"afterboot" man page (i.e. after you exit the mail subsystem, type
"man afterboot").  If you are not familiar with how to read man pages, type
"man man" at a shell prompt and read the entire thing.  Pay specific
attention to the "man -k keyword" option, which will permit you to find the
man page you are looking for more easily; for instance, "man -k ethernet".
The GNU "info" subsystem is also installed with further documentation
resources: to read info pages type "info".  (The info subsystem behaves like
the popular emacs editor.)

Again, PLEASE READ THE MANUAL PAGES.  OpenBSD developers have spent countless
hours improving them so that they are clear and precise.

Several popular binary packages (pre-compiled applications) are
available from mirror sites.  Mirror selection is usually automatic
during install/upgrade -- a mirror URL from https://www.secbsd.org/mirrors.html
is stored into the file /etc/installurl.  Installation of packages is
as simple as:

 # pkg_add -v metasploit

Significant efforts were made to centralize all system configuration in the
/etc directory.  You should be able to find each of the configuration files
you seek there, lightly documented.  In particular, much of the configuration
has been centralized in the file /etc/rc.conf.  You should not need to ever
edit the file /etc/rc.   The files /etc/rc.securelevel and /etc/rc.local exist
for this purpose; the first is run before the system has gone into secure
mode; the second is run afterwards (if in doubt, add your tools to rc.local).

Please refer to our web pages for any other questions you might have.

SecBSD is free software.  You can do with it as you like, subject to very few
conditions (described at www.SecBSD.org/policy.html).  But free software isn't
written without money.  Network links, hardware costs, release engineering and
testing work all take money and significant effort on the part of those who
have made this SecBSD release what it is.  Please reward the developers who
have made SecBSD what it is, and thus make it possible for this wonderful
process to continue.  For more information on how you can help, please see
www.SecBSD.org/sponsors.html to see a list of those who have donated
list of those who have donated money, equipment, or other resources to ensure
money, equipment, or other resources to ensure SecBSD continues.
