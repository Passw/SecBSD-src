As complete as your SecBSD system is, you may want to add any of several
excellent third party software applications.  There are several ways to do
this.  You can:

1) Use the SecBSD package collection to grab a pre-compiled
   and tested version of the application for your hardware.

2) Use the SecBSD ports collection to automatically get any
   needed source file, apply any required patches, create the
   application, and install it for you.

3) Obtain the source code and build the application based
   upon whatever installation procedures are provided with the
   application.

Instructions for installing applications from the various sources using
the different installation methods follow.

You should also refer to the packages(7) manual page.

Installing applications from the mirror.SecBSD.org package collection:

	All available packages for your architecture have been placed on
	mirror.SecBSD.org in the directory pub/SecBSD/OSREV/packages/MACHINE_ARCH/
	You may want to peruse this to see what packages are available.  The
	packages are also on the SecBSD mirror sites.  See

		https://www.SecBSD.org/mirrors.html

	for a list of current mirror sites.

	Installation of a package is very easy.
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) use the "pkg_add" command to install the software

	"pkg_add" is smart enough to know how to download the software
	from the SecBSD HTTP server.  Example:

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    # pkg_add metasploit

Installing applications from the SecBSD ports collection:

	See https://www.secbsd.org/docs.html for current
	instructions on obtaining and installing SecBSD ports.

	You should also refer to the ports(7) manual page.

Installing other applications:

	If an SecBSD package or port does not exist for an application
	you're pretty much on your own.  The first thing to do is ask
	<purplerain@SecBSD.org> if anyone is working on a port -- there may
	be one in progress.  If no such port exists, you might want to
	look at the FreeBSD ports or NetBSD pkgsrc for inspiration.

	If you can't find an existing port, try to make your own and
	feed it back to SecBSD.  That's how our ports collection grows.
	Some details can be found in the OpenBSD Porter's Handbook at
	https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/
