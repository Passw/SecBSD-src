Information for prospective mirrors

To be listed on this page we require mirrors to be fast, up to date,
capable, and well-connected to networks in the region in which they serve.

Mirrors must carry the following:

    OS and packages for all architectures supported by SecBSD

As of December 2023, the minimum space required is approximately 200GB.

However, to reduce problems for users when snapshot packages are updated,
it is strongly recommended to use the rsync options
--delete-delay --delay-updates which requires additional space during updates.
--fuzzy may also be helpful to reduce the amount of data transferred
when updating snapshot packages. Depending on the disk space available,
mirrors may provide more contents, such as older releases, current source tree, etc.

Operators of mirrors who are interested in having their site added to the list
on this page should contact purplerain@secbsd.org with further details about their site,
including network connectivity, geographic location, and general information.
