INSTALLATION NOTES for SecBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is SecBSD?
---------------

SecBSD is a security-focused UNIX-like operating system for security
researchers, pentesters, bug hunters and cybersecurity folks.

SecBSD is based on OpenBSD, a fully functional, multi-platform UN*X-like
Operating System based on Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2)
and 4.4BSD-Lite.

There are several operating systems in this family, but SecBSD like
OpenBSD differentiates itself by putting security and correctness first.
The SecBSD team strives to achieve what is called a "secure by default"
status.  This means that an SecBSD user should feel safe that their
newly installed machine will not be compromised.  This "secure by
default" goal is achieved by taking a proactive stance on security.

Since security flaws are essentially mistakes in design or implement-
ation, the SecBSD team puts as much importance on finding and fixing
existing design flaws and implementation bugs as it does writing new
code.  This means that an SecBSD system will not only be more secure,
but it will be more stable.  The source code for all critical system
components has been checked for remote-access, local-access, denial-
of-service, data destruction, and information-gathering problems.

In addition to bug fixing, SecBSD has integrated strong cryptography
into the base system.  A fully functional IPsec implementation is
provided as well as support for common protocols such as SSL and SSH.
Network filtering and monitoring tools such as packet filtering, NAT,
and bridging are also standard, as well as several routing services,
such as BGP and OSPF.  For high performance demands, support for
hardware cryptography has also been added to the base system.  Because
security is often seen as a tradeoff with usability, SecBSD provides
as many security options as possible to allow the user to enjoy secure
computing without feeling burdened by it.

Because SecBSD is from The Netherlands, the export of Cryptography pieces
(such as OpenSSH and IPsec) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: SecBSD can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
a mirror server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

Sources of SecBSD:
------------------

Please refer to https://www.secbsd.org for all the ways you may
acquire SecBSD.


SecBSD OSREV Release Contents:
----------------------------

The SecBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the
.../OSREV directory, for each of the architectures having an SecBSD OSREV
binary distribution, there is a sub-directory.

SecBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
-------------------------------------------------

Verifying the SecBSD Installation Media:
----------------------------------------

SecBSD installations are able to verify files for the next
release.  The SecBSD OSREV release was signed with the
/etc/signify/secbsd-{:--:}OSrev-base.pub release key.

If you have an existing SecBSD installation, you can run signify(1)
to verify the signature and checksum.  For example, run the following
to verify that the cd{:--:}OSrev.iso file was distributed by the SecBSD team:
	signify -C -p /etc/signify/secbsd-{:--:}OSrev-base.pub -x SHA256.sig cd{:--:}OSrev.iso

If you are unable to run or compile signify(1), use sha256(1) with the SHA256
file to see if a file was corrupt during the transfer.

Upgrading a previously-installed SecBSD System:

Getting source code for your SecBSD System:
-------------------------------------------

Now that your SecBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

You can get the pieces over the internet using anonymous CVS, rsync,
FTP or HTTP(s). For more information, see:

	https://git.laylo.io/secbsd


Using online SecBSD documentation:
----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual pages
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by "name(section)".  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The "man" command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering "man [section] topic".  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.

Bugs:
-----

To report bugs, use the "sendbug" command shipped with SecBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports {:-include-:} lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	purplerain@secbsd.org
